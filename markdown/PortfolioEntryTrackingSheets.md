Tips for Using These Sheets:

1. Use consistent IDs across sheets
2. Use comma-separated values for multiple entries
3. Keep keywords consistent for better searching
4. Date format should be consistent (YYYY-MM-DD)
5. Use dropdown lists for standard values
6. Create a separate sheet for standard values/enums
7. Use color coding for status/progress
8. Include a README sheet with instructions

Would you like me to:

1. Create a template with examples?
2. Add more specific fields for certain sheets?
3. Explain the relationship mapping in more detail?
4. Suggest a tool for maintaining these sheets?
