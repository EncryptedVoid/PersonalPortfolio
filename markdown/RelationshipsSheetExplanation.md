Example Relationships:

1. Skill → Project

```
ID: R001
Source Type: Skill
Source ID: React
Relationship Type: Used In
Target Type: Project
Target ID: Portfolio Website
Strength: Primary
Description: Main framework used to build the project
```

2. Course → Skill

```
ID: R002
Source Type: Course
Source ID: Advanced React & GraphQL
Relationship Type: Teaches
Target Type: Skill
Target ID: React
Strength: Primary
Description: Core course material focused on React
```

3. Job → Project

```
ID: R003
Source Type: Job
Source ID: Google Internship
Relationship Type: Developed
Target Type: Project
Target ID: Search Algorithm
Strength: Primary
Description: Main project during internship
```

Common Relationship Types:
```
- Teaches (Course → Skill)
- Used In (Skill → Project)
- Required For (Skill → Job)
- Developed During (Project → Job)
- Validates (Certification → Skill)
- Prerequisite For (Course → Course)
- Part Of (Project → Project)
- Leads To (Skill → Skill)
```

However, I realize now that the RELATIONSHIPS SHEET might be unnecessarily complex for a portfolio website. Instead, you could:

1. Add relationship columns directly in each sheet:
   
SKILLS:
```
- Used In Projects (list of Project IDs)
- Taught In Courses (list of Course IDs)
- Used In Jobs (list of Job IDs)
- Validated By Certs (list of Cert IDs)
```

PROJECTS:
```
- Primary Skills (list of Skill IDs)
- Secondary Skills (list of Skill IDs)
- Related Courses (list of Course IDs)
- Developed At (Job ID)
```

COURSES:
```
- Skills Taught (list of Skill IDs)
- Projects Completed (list of Project IDs)
- Related Certifications (list of Cert IDs)
```

This approach is:

- Simpler to maintain
- Easier to understand
- More direct
- Less prone to errors

Would you like me to:

1. Remove the RELATIONSHIPS SHEET and update the other sheets with direct relationship columns?
2. Show more examples of how to track relationships within each sheet?
3. Provide a simpler organization structure?
