   - Implement base layout components
   - Create responsive grid system
   - Set up design tokens and theme

2. Core Content Phase:
   - Build main sections (About, Skills, Projects)
   - Implement responsive navigation
   - Set up basic routing
   - Add static content

3. Integration Phase:
   - Connect API data sources
   - Implement data fetching
   - Add loading states
